# cattle-breed-classification-of-the-cattle-and-buffalo
Accurate identification of cattle and buffalo breeds is important for livestock management, dairy production optimization, breeding programs, and animal health monitoring. This project builds an image-based classification model to help farmers, researchers, and agri-tech systems recognize livestock breeds automatically.
# Pointers 
Image-based breed classification for cattle and buffalo 
Supports multiple breeds (e.g., Gir, Kankrej, Murrah, Jafarabadi, etc.)
Preprocessing pipeline including resizing, normalization, and augmentation
Deep learning model built using CNNs / Transfer Learning (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet, MobileNet)
Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix
Exportable trained model for integration into mobile or web applications
